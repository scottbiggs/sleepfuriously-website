    <title>Android Apps</title>

    <description>For several months, I have been teaching myself the fascinating world of Google&#x2019;s Android operating system.  I have written dozens of little apps--mostly tutorials on the various aspects of this tiny portable computer.

My philosophy is to write little apps that do one thing well.  Make it tight, make it cute, and make it work.  Then let anyone use it.

Bigger programs (like the workout app), well that&#x2019;s another story.</description>

      <description>Okay, I did it again.  I&#x2019;m publishing another app.  This is actually something that I needed and used and saved some money with.  It&#x2019;s a little program that checks out your phone&#x2019;s hardware and determines if it has a proximity detector or not.  And if it does, it tells you about it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What&#x2019;s a proximity detector?  Pretty simple, really.  It&#x2019;s special hardware that determines if you are talking on your phone or not.  It usually works by shining a little infrared light.  If it bounces off your ear into a light detector, then it assumes you&#x2019;re talking on your phone.  Otherwise it assumes you&#x2019;re looking at it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is how your phone knows to turn off the screen while you&#x2019;re talking and turn it back on again so you can hang up.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I had a phone that was a real bitch to hang up.  Why?  It seemed as if it didn&#x2019;t know if I was talking or not.  ...some code later, and I noticed that it did not have one of these detectors.  Unacceptable.  Phone returned, and now I have a much better phone that I can actually use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I just uploaded this to the Google Market, so the link hasn&#x2019;t been created yet, sorry.  But for you sly and sexy readers of my blog, you can download it here: &lt;a href="Entries/2012/2/17_OMG%21_Not_another_little_app%21_files/proximity.apk"&gt;proximity.apk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sorry about the long bit with no updates--I&#x2019;ve been busy (hehe).</description>

      <description>Yep, here&#x2019;s a new one.  And it&#x2019;s in 3D--just like your face!  While I&#x2019;ve written two 3D graphics engines myself and extensively used two others, I&#x2019;ve never really played with OpenGL (the open-source 3D graphics system used by everyone from John Carmack of Quake fame to every open-source game-geek alive).  So I&#x2019;m filling that hole while doing a neat little Android app at the same time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this uses OpenGL ES, the version made especially for mobile devices like Android and iPhones.  To be honest, OpenGL ES is really not mature yet--lots and lots of really useful things are missing.  And some important things are nearly impossible to do (like certain error condition tests!).  But you can definitely do a lot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To get this thing out and working quickly, I didn&#x2019;t bother with a true light source, but it&#x2019;s fun enough and works.  The hard part was making the shapes myself.  I used graph paper, pencils, and a lot of erasers (my floor is covered with tiny eraser bits--kind of funny to walk on).  Check it out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="Entries/2011/12/4_Trippy_Tic_Tac_Toe_files/trippy_tictactoe.apk"&gt;trippy_tictactoe.apk&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing a new calculator for SMPTE</title>

      <description>Okay, after what I thought was going to be a no-brainer quickie app, I&#x2019;m finally ready to announce a calculator for people who deal with timecodes (primarily editors, directors, sound designers, etc.).  Whew, not only was the basic algorithm a major hurdle, but because I thought this was going to be easy I coded fast and loose.  Now there&#x2019;s the payback of bunches of bugs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, I&#x2019;m releasing a Beta version (v. 0.9).  I expect bugs here; so should you.  And tell me about &#x2018;em.  They *will* be fixed.  And then there&#x2019;ll be the real release, a nice clean version (1.0, yay!).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yeah, like my other little apps, this will be a no-cost add-free app for the Android.  So ask for it on you Android Market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;App Features:&lt;br/&gt;	*	Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide SMPTE timecodes.&lt;br/&gt;	*	Set any frame rate from 3 to 99 frames per second.&lt;br/&gt;	*	Correctly and intuitively works with Drop Frame timecodes, used extensively in NTSC environments.&lt;br/&gt;	*	Works nicely with built-in keyboards.&lt;br/&gt;	*	Optionally implements sound and haptic (vibrations) feedback.&lt;br/&gt;	*	Saves your preferences.</description>

      <description>Was showing friends my stopwatch app at a party last night, and one guy thought it was a countdown timer for the &#x201C;rapture&#x201D; yesterday.  Cute.  Fortunately no one at that particular party flew up into the air, so we all had a good time.  A *very* good time!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So I&#x2019;m gonna make a count-down timer app.  Why not?  The stopwatch worked rather nicely, and this is essentially just going in reverse.  It&#x2019;s all about the user interface now.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So as soon as I get the stopwatch on the marketplace, look out for the countdown timer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh yeah, if any of you have UI ideas or a nice drawing for an icon, give me a buzz.</description>

      <description>Okay, just got this thing working very nicely on my Motorola Backflip (OS 2.1--yep, I upgraded from 1.5; well worth it).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This little thingy was fun!  Took me only eight hours to make it work flawlessly.  I spent another day adding a few minor features (like the option to have sound or vibrations) and testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oh yeah, it should work well into the 22nd century, counting the seconds all the way.  And yeah, it uses NO processor time when running in the background!  Isn&#x2019;t that neat?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It&#x2019;s available NOW on the marketplace.  Want to skip the marketplace? then download the apk directly by right-clicking on the icon above and choose &#x201C;save-link-as&#x201D;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Be the first on your block to have this nice and simple app that...keeps track of elapsed time!  Weeeee!</description>
