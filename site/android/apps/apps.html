					<h6>Biggs' Trippy Tic Tac Toe</h6>
					<p>
						I've done a LOT of 3D graphcs. But I never used OpenGL (I usually wrote my own 3D libraries). And certainly never
						did any 3D on Androids. So I wrote this app to fill that hole. Kind of fun,
						if you like tic tac toe.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						One interesting tidbit: I didn't go to the trouble to write an editor. So I
						made all the 3D shapes from scratch using graph paper. Felt real old-school!
						<br/>
						<br/>
						One more tidbit: I based the AI on a chicken I saw playing tic tac toe at the
						Texas State Fair. It's good, but <em>can</em> be beaten! (And if your ego is still
						deflated, you can change the difficulty to make it even easier.)

					<h6>Biggs' Movie Calculator</h6>
					<p>
						Let's say you're editing a music video, and you want to make sure it is exactly
						three minutes and fourteen seconds long. You have 2:47 already done. How long should
						the last clip be?
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Yeah, I don't like doing that kind of math either. And if you add in <em>frames</em>
						it gets even more fun (especially drop-frame, multiple frame rates, etc.)! So I made 
						this calculator. Great for film, video, and sound editors!
						<br/>
						<br/>
						This is a <em>very</em> useful program for me and those few who really need it, and the icon turned out great (spent enough time on it!).

					<h6>Biggs' Proximity Detector</h6>
					<p>
						One phone I bought behaved oddly: it never "turned on" when I pulled it away from
						my ear when talking, which made hanging up a real nuisance. One question led to another
						and I ended up with a program that detects and plays with the proximity detector on
						your phone.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						This tiny little app detects if your device has a proximity detector. And if it does,
						displays the readings that it gives off. Some are <em>much</em> more detailed than
						others. How swank is your phone's proximity detector?

					<h6>biggs' hardware info</h6>
					<p>
						Curious about your CPU on your device? Well <em>I</em> was. So I wrote this little thing.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						All it does is display the official string that's embedded in the hardware of each device.
						So don't whine to me if your information is less than useful--complain to your manufacture.
						I'm just the messenger!

					<h6>Biggs' Stopwatch</h6>
					<p>
						My first android phone didn't have a stopwatch app. So I wrote one.
						It's pretty basic, but does the job nicely.
