				<div class="big">Bach-Style Invention</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p></p>
						Here's an interesting little study. I found a clever
						fugue that JS wrote based on a theme by Albinoni. You
						can listen to Bach's fugue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQjF0TNsDCk">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>I copied the theme and waited until I forgot what JS did.
						Then it was my turn. Here's a short little 3-part invention
						on the same theme by Albinoni. I will say that this theme
						is rather romantic--quite <em>un</em>baroque. And those
						chromaticisms posed some interesting problems.
					</p>
					<p>While I'm mostly pleased with my solution, I stand in awe
					of JS's fugue.</p>

					<p>And here's a very bland version of this invention,
					played by a computer (blech!). Middle click these links (command-click on Mac)
					to listen and watch at the same time.
					<a href="sound/invention on theme by albinoni (one track) - slightly faster.mp3">vanilla piano</a></p>
					<p>This version uses different instrumets to better hear
					the three different parts. But it's still a computer playing, sigh.
					<a href="sound/invention on theme by albinoni (for Autumn).mp3">vanilla three instruments</a>.</p>
					<p>Please let me know if you make a recording. I'll give you credit and put it up here (or
					make a link, whichever you like)!</p>
					<p>Now that I've gone through the exercise, I have a much deeper and more
					profound appreciation for the genius of JS Bach. What I did with the theme
					was nice, which I patted myself on the back as this was a very odd and tricky little
					theme to work with. But what he did is brilliant! Rather than being stumped, Bach took this anti-baroque melody
					and used the oddness to fuel the fire,
					making it sound effortless, invigorating, and always driving to the finish.
					I'm daunted by Bach's amazing skill.</p>
