				<h2>Nethack</h2>
				<h5>Hard Place for Mighty Dog the Monk</h5>
				<p>
					Yeah, recently got back into Nethack--best
					computer game <em>ever</em>! If you know nothing about
					the game, find out all about it at the <a target="_newtab" href="http://www.nethack.org/">main site</a>
					and the
					<a target="_newtab" href="http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page">nethack wiki</a>.
					While you can download and play on whatever-computer-is-handy,
					I prefer to play on the public and
					free server <a target="_newtab" href="http://alt.org/nethack/">here</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					I got back into playing about a week or so
					ago from a conversation during dinner. It had been a haitus of
					about three years. While I'm not a great player, I do
					know quite a bit as I've been playing since the late
					eighties.
				</p>
				<p>
					I usually play a Tourist, one of the hardest characters
					at first, but surprisingly good towards the end (thanks
					to the extremely useful quest artifact). Of my three
					ascendancies, my last two were with Tourists.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I resumed playing on the public <a target="_newtab" href="http://alt.org/nethack/">server</a> (and
					after luckily guessing my old password), I found that
					several years ago, I had started a Barbarian, so I continued
					playing that character with fair success.
				</p>
				<p>
					But as usual, Mighty Dog the Barbarian died <a target="_newtab" href="http://nethack.wikia.com/wiki/Yet_Another_Stupid_Death">YASD</a>. So it goes.
					My good friend, Chris (experienced) and my girlfriend (complete novice)
					started playing too. We sometimes just hang out at my house,
					playing nethack or watching each other play. Despite what
					you're thinking, playing together like that can be quite social.
				</p>
				<p>
					After several failed restarts with various characters, I resolved
					to try to ascend as a Monk AND maintain vegetarian AND weaponless status. Yeah,
					it's not easy, but I'm feeling cocky.
				</p>
				<p>
					My monk is doing quite well: great pet, decent hit points,
					tenth level, sleep spell, detect monster, and light. So I guess
					I'm ready to get that luckstone in the bottom of the mines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although monk Mighty Dog has crappy AC (Minetown was pretty lame as were
					the few shops I've found) he's at Expert level hand-to-hand and
					the monsters of the mines fall without much problem. If things get rough, I
					can easily cast a bunch of sleep spells and work it out. Andy,
					my dog, is big and healthy from a steady diet of gnomes and dwarves.
				</p>
				<p>
					But then something very unusual happens at level 10 of the Gnomish
					mines: I find an <span class="weird">Iron Golem</span>. What the hell is an Iron Golem doing
					here?  They're <em>waaaay</em> too hard for the mines! But they
					are slow and I'm fast; I'll run around it on the way out. At least
					that's what I'm thinking as I descend to level 11.
				</p>
				<p>
					For those who've never played monks, they get the Warning intrinsic
					fairly early. With this, even if you can't see a monster, you can tell that a
					baddie is nearby with this intrinsic.
				</p>
				<p>
					And with this warning I saw something very nasty moving towards me on this 11th level.
					Since I was near the down stairs, I went ahead and went down again.
					If nothing else, I should be able to better fight this nasty (or run
					around it) with a luckstone, right? By the way, how far down does this
					Gnomish Mine go?
				</p>
				<p>
					Down to level 12. Yup, it looks like the base; I'm in the middle of
					an open room and tons of dwarves, gnomes, and hobbits are surrounding
					me. Piece o' cake. Clear the big room and start searching for the
					luckstone.  And then...
				</p>
				<p>
					A <span class="super_nuts">balrog</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Are you fucking kidding me? What the hell (pun intended) is that doing
					in the Gnomish Mines? No time to look for a polymorph trap, some weird
					bones pile, a wand, etc., no time to wait for a chameleon to change!
					<strong>Abort abort abort</strong>!!!
				</p>
				<p>
					I high-tail it back up to level 11 before the balrog can kick my ass.
					And guess what's waiting for me? Yep, that thing I was warned about
					was in fact a <span class="nuts">master lich</span>! And the first thing he does is destroy
					my armor, curse my tools, and cast Summon Nasties twice.
				</p>
				<p>
					I see <em>another</em> <span class="weird">iron</span> golem AND a
					<span class="weird">yellow dragon</span> pop up to help
					the Master Lich finish me off (along with a slew of other monsters
					more appropriate to this level).
					<br>
					So here's where I am now:
				</p>
				<img class="centered" src="nethack_lich1.jpg" alt="nethack shot--not looking too good"/>
				<p>
					Yeah, that '2' above and to the right of me is the yellow dragon coming
					with the iron golem just behind it. You can see how I dug like crazy
					just to make it to the stairs with the Master Lich riding my ass all
					the way.
				</p>
				<p>
					I am now standing on the up stairs (Elbereth engraved with a wand of digging),
					but the Master Lich will simply go up
					with me. While Elbereth will protect me from hits, it doesn't stop the
					Master Lich from casting spells, and he's been going crazy!
				</p>
				<p>
					And even if I make it past the Master Lich (a very big IF!), there's still
					the OTHER iron golem on level 10 waiting for me. Sigh.
				</p>
				<h5>So...what am I to do?</h5>
				<p>
					Any hints will be laughed at and then taken very seriously.

				<h5>Follow-up</h5>
				<p>
					Well, after thinking about it and talking about it with friends
					for a couple of days, I decided to try and fight it out with that
					damn Master Lich.
				</p>
				<p>
					I wasn't doing much damage to him/it, but fortunately he wasn't
					doing too much to me either (monks have cold resistance). But the
					nasties were closing in on me, and <em>they</em> were taking me
					down. But my dog, Andy, managed to kill the Carnivorous Ape that
					was crushing me--good dog!
				</p>
				<p>
					And I did a good hit to the Master Lich, "The Master Lich staggers
					from your powerful strike!" causing it to take a step back. And
					faster than you can blink, I was up those stairs. "Andy is still
					eating. Andy's leash snaps loose!" Sorry, Andy. I'll come back
					for you later.
				</p>
				<p>
					Parents know that they often make promises that they can't guarantee.
					And while I very much planned to come back and rescue my
					poor Andy (much later, after I had gained a LOT of levels), my
					monk's time in the Dungeons of Doom came to an end after trying
					to get yet another unicorn horn. Damn, those things can hit <strong>hard</strong>.

				<h2>New Character</h2>
				<h5>Another Monk</h5>
				<p>This guy is doing quite a bit better. First of all, I waited before
				doing the quest. Yeah, a loooong time--like well after doing Valley of the Dead!
				Master Kaen is <em>nasty</em>! Glad I waited</p>
				<p>But I'm getting ahead of myself. This new monk was doing very well in
				general (but he lost his robe on the 2nd level by reading an unidentified
				scroll of Destroy Armor. Bye-bye spell casting for a while! But once he
				made it to Sokoban, I started playing very carefully, and I managed to
				keep him alive in spite of everything (thanks much to his ability to
				cast Sleep spells--still 12% fail which seemed to happen ALL THE TIME!).</p>
				<p>But I fucked up this monk, twice. 1) I forgot that black puddings
				break vegetarian conduct (brown puddings are fine, even delicious). Sigh,
				well at least I can get telepathy! 2) Forgot I was still wielding a pick-axe
				and accidentally bumped into a monster. Good-bye weaponless conduct! Unfortunately as
				a chaotic, the weapons I can get through #offering aren't any better than my fists.</p>
				<p>Whereas the previous dungeon kept dealing me insanely difficult
				monsters, this dungeon stymied me with a dearth good things. For example,
				only two shops were open in Mine Town (Izchak's and a food store),
				and the first altar I found was on level 18. As I write this, I
				still can't believe it.</p>
				<p>Thanks to successfully
				luring wraiths down from the Valley to Gehennom, I went from 16th level to
				26th very quickly (yay!). But I still had to wish for things that are
				typically found.</p>
				<p>
					<h6>Wishes so far:</h6>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="standout">Eye of Aethiopica</span>
							<p>Talk about a dumb move! My guy is chaotic; he can't even pick the
							damn thing up! Wasted that magic lamp.</p>
							<p>So it goes.</p>
						</li>

						<li><span class="standout">Bag of Holding</span>
							<p>Yup, got the amulet of reflection in Sokoban
							and never found even a plain sack until level 19.
							That sucked! Funny, found two more deep in Gehennom.</p>
						</li>

						<li><span class="standout">Tinning Kit</span>
							<p>Boy, this was one hell of a sad dungeon when you can't even
							find a tinning kit! But when you're fighting a bunch of trolls
							it's indespensible (and very nice too when fighting giants).
							But I did actually find one, after I was a Master (30th level)!</p>
						</li>

						<li><span class="standout">Master Key of Thievery</span>
							<p>This is a common wish for chaotics. The half physical
							damage makes such a difference! Unfortunately I thought it
							came with magic resistance (most quest artifacts do), but
							it doesn't, much to my sadness (<a href="#yasd1">see below</a>).</p>
						</li>

						<li><span class="standout">Magic Marker</span>
							<p>Probably the first thing most wish for
							once they've reached the castle.</p>
						</li>

						<li><span class="standout">Speed Boots, Robe, Helm of Brilliance</span>
							<p>Seriously. Never found any of these in the entire dungeon! And
							yes, I searched Gehennom meticulously! And I wasted two
							wands of polymorph poly-piling for these (yes, I DID start with
							magic armor--I'm not that stupid).</p>
						</li>

						<li><span class="standout">Can of Grease</span>
							<p>Can't believe I had to burn a wish on this, but it's the
							easiest way to be safe from kraken (oh yeah, I never found
							an oilskin cloak either!).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h5>Oh, the Irony!</h5>
				<p>While playing nethack you have luck that is amazing in ways that can make
				you jump for joy, laugh out loud, or more commonly: cry. And
				then there are times where some amazing stroke of luck just makes
				you scratch your head and mutter.</p>
				<p>I had a monk that did pretty well. Despite a dungeon that was void
				of most of the useful items, I got lucky with wishes, and I was able
				to get things that way (but it kind of sucks wishing for things like a can of
				grease, speed boots, etc.). And I quickly found my monk a Master (level 30),
				yay!</p>
				<p>As my monk was chaotic, I wished for the Rogue's quest artifact,
				The Master Key of Thievery. Half damage just carrying it, yeah! Combining
				those with The Eyes of the Overworld (my own quest artifact) made life quite
				nice.</p>
				<p>Got my ascension kit together (two amulets of life saving, two bags
				of holding, extra magic missile spellbooks, scrolls of genocide, lots of
				potions of full healing, two rings of conflict, levitation, everything
				blessed, as many holywaters as I could easily carry, 438 HP, AC -28, etc etc. I was <em>ready</em>!</p>
				<p>And then I started fighting <a href="http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Wizard_of_Yendor">Rodney</a>.
				First thing, he stole my lenses. Not to worry, that's not my only magic resistance;
				I still have the Rogue's key. "Uh oh, he's using the touch of death..." and then,
				"Do you want your possessions identified?" Oh shit.</p>
				<img class="centered" src="mightdog_monk_smaller.png" width="600" height="456" alt="tombstone"/>
				<p>All that work, all that prep (I spent over a week making sure I was
				completely prepared), done: <a href="http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Instadeath">instadeath</a>.
				I screwed up: the Master Key of Thievery does NOT provide magic resistance
				like I thought it did! I was wearing a robe for spell-casting, and an amulet of
				reflection (no armor), so after Rodney stole my lens artifact I was stuck without
				any magic resistance. I didn't even think to put on an amulet of life-saving as
				I still had 420+ HP.</p>
				<p>Lesson learned. Make sure what you think you know is actually right. Sigh.</p>

				<h3>Trying Again</h3>
				<h5>But Still Bad Luck!</h5>
				<p>Got another monk going. And I just made it to the bottom of the mines
				and back to Mine Town. I went to about level 12 or 13 before trying the
				mines as I've been having some very bad luck. "Like what?" you ask...</p>
				<p>Well, I've gone through more than twenty levels and have only seen
				one unicorn. Of course, it was my alignment.</p>
				<p>Aaaannd, the only altar I've found is the one in Mine Town. I'm still
				not high enough level to handle the priestess who's guarding it. Thus
				I have no way to get more holy waters (spent 'em all on a wish, see
				below), and I have no reliable way to tell when it's safe to pray.</p>
				<p>Consequently, my god is mad at me. Trying to stay vegetarian, but
				haven't found much yet. Heading to Sokoban asap! And then I hope
				I can find an altar AND some unicorns; Otherise, It'll be like playing
				an atheist without actually getting the credit.</p>
				<p>Found four bags--and they all cost 1 gold. Sigh.</p>

				<h3>And now for something completely different...</h3>
				<h5>How About an Archeologist?</h5>
				<p>Not doing too well, with monks, so when posed with the familiar,
				"Shall I pick a character's race, role, gender and alignment for you? [ynq]"
				I looked over the options and chose some unusual things.</p>
				<p>The archeologist was chosen as I was reading up on <a target="_newtab" href="http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Protection_racket">the protection
				racket</a>. Because of the touchstone and pickaxe, archeologists have
				a good chance of getting enough money early to play this way.
				And then I chose lawful. I rarely play lawful and don't know much about it.
				But I was thinking about what artifacts and what weapons archeologists can use....</p>
				<p>And I'm off. Lousy strength, medium low IQ, not a great character. But there's an
				altar on level 1! Oh yeah, another on level 4, nice. Unfortunately, I would later
				discover that these were the <em>only</em> altars in the regular dungeon! What a pain.</p>
				<p>Dungeon level 5, and I still don't have what it takes to get past Mine Town, and
				definitely haven't found enough $ or * to get much protection (level 4). And then a
				miracle happened: lying on the floor of a room is a <strong>Wand of Wishing</strong>!
				Oh yes, Quetzalcoatl likes me, he <em>really</em> likes me!</p>
				<p>Without much thought, zap! The blessed +2 silver saber named Grayswandir is in my
				hand. After that, it was actually pretty easy (just don't make any stupid mistakes).
				The Orb of Detection was the only other artifact that I used (my quest artifact), but
				I abandoned it while making my ascension kit--just too heavy. The other artifacts I received
				were from praying: Demonbane, Ogremasher, and Firebrand (which I used just enough to
				get Basic skill level).</p>
				<p>At the end I had 433 HP, my armor class was -38 (GDSM, Helm of Brilliance, Robe, Hawaiian Shirt,
				Speed Boots, Gauntlets of Power), I reflected from an amulet, two-weaponing with another
				silver saber (both at +7), and I wore a +4 ring of damage. Everything else was pretty standard.
				Oh yeah, I had a butt-load of spells, most at 0% failure.</p>
				<p>The actual ascension was pretty smooth. Rodney only reappeared six times and was pretty
				easy for me to kill (I averaged about 50hp per attack phase). This
				is my <span class="nuts">fourth</span> ascension, so it's still a very big deal for me.</p>
				<img class="centered" src="images/ascend_msg.png" alt="ascension message" width="626" height="284" />
				<p>Oh yeah, one funny thing: I thought I had identified all the
				dangerous amulets (I had) and identified one by putting it on (identify scrolls were scarce
				and I didn't get the spell until very late). Poof, now I'm a girl! Heehee.</p>
				<div class="sign_off">
					smb 5/15/2014

			<div class="box">
				<h4>Why am I <em>still</em> playing?</h4>
				<p>Okay, I've now ascended five or six times--haven't even bothered to write about
				most of them. My last ascension was with a Tourist, my old favorite (and still a fun
				one to win with!). And my girlfriend is wondering why I'm still playing this game.</p>
				<p>Sure, I've taken weeks off without even having the slightest desire to play nethack.
				But then I thought, "That Tourist quest was <em>really</em> different, and so was the
				Ranger quest. In fact, they were pretty cool and fun!"</p>
				<p>So I'm acknowledging that ascending is fairly tedious, so I don't have much desire
				to do that (also, the ascension kits are pretty similar regardless of what character you
				play; the only difference is spells or not). So I'm now keen on playing all the different
				character classes and doing their quests.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Tourist - check (ascended)</li>
					<li>Wizard - check (ascended)</li>
					<li>Valkyrie - check</li>
					<li>Monk - check (wow, what a <strong>hard</strong> quest!)</li>
					<li>Archeologist - check (ascended)</li>
					<li>Barbarian - check (ascended)</li>
					<li>Ranger - check (ascended, what an annoying Home level!)</li>
					<li>Knight - check (ascended, what a cool character!)</li>
					<li>Samurai - check (second try)</li>
					<li>Caveman - check (also took two tries)</li>
					<li>Healer - check (that Staff is a great artifact!)</li>
					<li>Priest - check (kind of annoying)</li>
					<li>Rogue - check (nearly impossible the first time!)</li>
					<span class="standout">- That's all of 'em!</span>
				</ul>
				<p>Having fun playing the Healers. The quest is not too bad, but I <em>love</em>
				that Staff of Aesculapius! So I'm still playing this character simply because
				I'm curious about the ins and outs of this fascinating artifact.</p>
				<p>Healers are pretty bad fighters. They can't get skilled at any good weapons.
				Seriously, unicorn horns are their best bet! But you can get expert in staff.
				Yes, 1-6 hp of damage (worse against large)--a pathetic amount.</p>
				<p>But the Healer
				artifact, the Staff of Aescalapius is a damn good weapon, even if it is two-handed.
				When wielding, I never have to worry about hit points as it gives hungerless
				regeneration AND sucks hit points from monsters and gives them to me.</p>
				<p>Oh yeah, I'm making it harder, too: I'm trying genocideless conduct. This is making
				life pretty hard; I had no idea just how difficult Liches can make life (the cursing
				of your inventory and the Summon Nasties that really hurt; they often summon more Liches!).</p>
				<p>So that's the continued fascination. Once I get over the novelty of this Healer artifact
				I'll probably go back and do the rest of the quests. I recommend it; they are quite interesting
				and different.</p>

				<h4>UnNethack, on to Better Things!</h4>
				<p>Having done all I want to do (most conducts are too tedious to be fun),
				I have been helping friends play, but haven't done much Nethack myself.</p>
				<p>Then I found a link to the UnNethack server! Yay! Here it is:</p>
				<p>us.un.nethack.nu</p>
				<p>Just telnet to this site and play. It's great! I've only just begun playing,
				but I'm already impressed. I even got my girlfriend to play the tutorial
				(regular Nethack should have something like this--fills in all the blanks that
				beginners struggle with). Very well done!</p>
				<p>UnNethack is a variant of 3.4 by <a target="_newtab"
				href="http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/User:Bhaak">
				Patric Mueller</a>. Many credits and kudos to him.</p>
				<p>And for you jaded hackers out there, try playing a Convict! (heehee!)</p>

			<div class="box">
				<h4>FRusTRatI0n!</h4>
				<p>Well, of course. That's what this game is all about.</p>
				<p>I've been trying to play the Convict, a new playter type brought to you
				by the good people of Unnethack. It was funny at first. But after dying
				so many times and so quickly, I'm beginning to get paranoid.</p>
				<p>Not only do you start with horrid equipment (except for some rocks, everything
				else is cursed), you start on the edge of hunger. Since you can't pray for 
				another 800 turns, you have an excellent chance of starving with this character.</p>
				<p>I've been playing by abandoning my pet (a rat named Nicodemus [wink]) and diving
				down as quickly as I can to find something to kill and eat. Obviously this puts you
				at levels where the monsters are much stronger than you are. Result: lots of deaths.</p>
				<p>And I'm ok with that. But apparently you also start with amazingly bad luck as well.
				I've been having not just a lot of YAAD, but bunches of, "Are you fucking kidding me?"
				deaths. Here's an example:</p>
				<img class="centered" src="images/bad_goblin.png" alt="ascension message"/>
				<p>Yeah.</p>
				<p>I'm definitely losing patience with this.</p>
