					<p>
						For those who know me, this website is
						redundant, even superfluous. But for everyone else,
						it could be useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						Pieced here and there are tidbits of my person
						that individually are pretty trivial. But taken
						as a whole begin to paint a rough sketch of
						me and what I think is important. Are those two
						things seperate? Well, yeah...sort of.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div class="box">
				<div class="big">Who am I?</div>
				<div class="text">
					<p>
						This is a pretty hard question. Who are <em>you</em>?
						See, not so easy. Like most people, I am a different
						person in different environments. While I'm not as extreme
						as <a target="_newtab" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig">Zelig</a>,
						I do modify my personality according to the
						situation far more than
						most people. The ability to see the world from many
						different views gives me unique perspectives and unusual solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="exclamation">What kind of jibberish is that?</span>
						For example, while working as a writer for an acting class,
						the teacher wanted more improvisation between the actors and
						their scene. My solution: pull up the piano and play different
						styles of music while they acted--sound tracks to inspire
						new thinking.
					</p>
					<p>
						Example 2: Our team was working late at night for a looming milestone.
						Each bug fix seemed to generate more problems. Tempers flared,
						accusations, yelling, and more started flying across the office.
						Scott's solution: I went home, despite dire threats from my boss.
						Since my code was integral, no one could continue. The team
						went home, got some sleep, and rejuvenated. The next day the bugs
						were fixed quickly and quietly.
					</p>
					<p>
						We missed the milestone by 1 day. But our team kept together
						and bonded more closely than ever, and we never missed another
						milestone. I reasoned to my boss in our 1-to-1 the next day that
						we had <strong>already</strong> missed our milestone if we
						couldn't meet it without killing each other. And if the negativity
						had continued, we would never finish the project. Missing one
						deadline is far better than missing the whole enchilada.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I look for <em><strong>and find</strong></em> elegant solutions that are "beyond
						the box." My experience and life pretty much puts me in a
						unique position to do exactly that, which suits me just fine (road
						less travelled and all that crap). And as a manager, I am consequently
						able to complete projects, insure high quality, and enjoy
						my job and co-workers at the same time.  All without the pleasure
						of spending six figures on a business school.

					<p>
						I was born a poor black child...no, that's someone
						else. I was actually born in Austin, Texas at
						the old Seton Hospital
						during the Army/Navy game. Yeah, that's a detail
						my father remembers as he spent the whole ordeal
						in a waiting room with a small black & white tv
						on. Mom's view was considerably more dramatic,
						painful, and intense.
					</p>
					<p>
						Fortunately, the flood of hormones that flow to
						mothers during delivery left her memory considerably
						blurred. All she remembers now is the joy of birth.
						Aren't moms great!
					</p>
					<p>
						I've tried to leave Austin many times, but I always
						come back, hence one of my favorite phrases, "Austin
						sucks!" (If you don't get it, you might as well quit
						reading and waste your time <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAg1r6zw7Bg">here</a>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						So I'm a long-time native, a unicorn. Stranger still,
						I moved into the house I grew up ten years ago. Yup,
						been fixing it up ever since--starting to look ok.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a teenager I thought I was going to be a world-famous
						composer. Somehow I managed to get into the New England
						Conservatory of Music (Boston) and spent a good deal of
						my parents' hard-earned money before getting some sense
						and transferred to University of North Texas (then it was
						NTSU). Still a decent music school, but <em>sooo</em> much
						cheaper. In those days, a Texas resident could take a
						full load for less than fifty dollars. No, I'm not that
						old; school was very cheap in the early 80s.
					</p>
					<p>
						The inexpensive school allowed me to take all sorts of things.
						And I found myself becoming a philosopher--music still a
						very big hobby, but no longer a demanding profession. To
						increase my philosophical knowledge, I transferred to UT
						(back in Austin again!) where I discovered I really hated
						writing papers for my philosphy courses.
					</p>
					<p>
						But computer programming doesn't require writing papers,
						and that's how I overcame my writer's block. And in a
						few agonizingly rough years I had a degree in Computer
						Science. yippee.
					</p>
					<p>
						My two favorite job interviews were for <a target="_newtab" href="http://www.giantbomb.com/origin-systems/3010-344/">Origin Systems</a>,
						a local game company, and <a target="_newtab" href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/">NASA</a> who needed people to write
						software for the international space station's life-support
						system. Origin made the first offer, which I happily accepted
						and steered me hard in the world of computer games.
					</p>
					<p>
						After two years or so of being taken advantage of, I followed
						the advice of a few co-workers who had started their own game companies.
						Jason Templeman started a company called <a target="_newtab"
						href="http://logicfactory.com">The Logic Factory</a>,
						which produced a couple of excellent games. Check 'em out.
					</p>
					<p>
						The other friend was Dave Taylor, of <a target="_newtab"
						href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software">Id Software</a>.
						They did even better than Jason--as you already know. John Carmack
						convinced me that shareware was the way to go: easy money without
						all the hassles of a distributor or marketing department. The internet
						would be my platform, and people would try and then pay for my
						games. It was a great idea, but it was just many years too early
						(this was 1994, only a handful of people had internet access!).
					</p>
					<p>
						By complete luck I had some Dell computer stocks purchased at the
						company's all-time low (around 1989). What was originally a bit more
						than $500 grew into enough to fund my company for about two years
						while we developed a pretty cool game.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was called <i>Get Lost!</i>, and you can check it out
						<a target="_newtab" href="../getlost/getlost.html">here</a>.
						Remember, computers were very primative back then. 3D graphics was
						something that not even movies did very often. I personally wrote
						half a million lines of C++ and assembly code to make an immersive
						first-person 3D game that ran on only 450 <em><strong>kilo</strong></em>bytes of memory.
						Yeah, that's about a tenth as big as a single photo on your cell phone.
					</p>
					<p>
						Of course, after two years and much heartbreak, I didn't have the
						gumption or the money to market the game. I sold about thirty copies.
						Only one of my Origin friends even bothered to look at it. It's still
						the biggest thing I've ever done and my biggest disappointment.
					</p>
					<p>
						After that, I found various programming jobs, mostly in games. But I
						did do a stint at <a target="_newtab" href="http://www.cyc.com/">Cycorp</a>, the famous artificial intelligence place.
						Turns out, I really liked programming in Lisp. But I truly loved
						my co-workers: most were PhD's in philosophy and linguistics. Talk about
						great conversations and super-interesting people! I've never seen
						an office with so many true genii. But my heart was broken, and I
						just couldn't give the company the concentration it deserved.
						Back to games!
					</p>
					<p>
						My general pattern had been to work like a dog, make a bunch of money, quit,
						travel, get a girlfriend, get low on money, get dumped, and then get
						another job. With my credentials, getting a programming job at a
						game company was a cinch. In fact, I had gotten so good at game programming,
						that I preferred debugging (ask any programmer--they <em>hate</em> debugging
						because it's <strong>so</strong> hard). On one job, I travelled North
						America debugging clients' software: have-manual,
						will travel!
					</p>
					<p>
						During one haitus, many little coincidences happened. And I found myself
						in a most unusual and thrilling position.
					</p>
					<p>
						I don't know if you've ever worked on a movie, but usually the experience
						is pretty awful. As I like movies and am a curious fellow, I worked on
						a couple and discovered this first-hand. The problem is that there
						are a lot of people trying to do something that's nearly impossible
						with next-to-no money and half the time. The work is naturally very
						difficult, and people are put in positions to be taken advantage of
						constantly. Even angels can get exhausted, hungry, sleep-deprived,
						and snap at mistakes (which <strong>happen all the time</strong>).
					</p>
					<p>
						And at this time I found myself in the position of directing a tiny
						little movie. Lucky? oh boy am I! And I thought to myself, "Well, since
						I'm the one in charge, I can do things differently. I won't screw around,
						and I will be very prepared. I can make this experience a <em>much</em>
						more pleasant thing than I've seen. In fact, we might even have fun!"
					</p>
					<p>
						And we did. It turns out that all my weird jobs, unusual studies, strange
						hobbies, philosophical inquiries, had perfectly prepared me for directing
						movies. I was not only good at directing, people loved working with me.
						You can look at my production company here: <a target="_newtab" href="../sfs/sfs.html">Sleep
						Furiously Studios</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I made movies: shorts, music videos, industrial films, experimentals, and
						more. Every morning I jumped out of bed with energy to get to work. I really
						loved this job; I even loved the enormous amount of energy it demanded.
					</p>
					<p>
						But it didn't pay. After years of trying, I couldn't even come close to
						breaking even. Bitterness crept in. Even the film festivals that I loved
						attending started showing crappier and crappier films. Bitterness turned
						to jadedness turned to abandonment.
					</p>
					<p>
						But now I am many years out of the development world. No one wants to
						take a chance on a programmer with no recent work. That's where I am
						now, lingering along, trying to get a job in a market that seems to be
						teeming with programming jobs, but none for yours truly. I even learned
						to program Android mobile devices, detailed <a target="_newtab"
						href="../android/android.html">here</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Accepting that I'm not going to be a programmer, which I though would
						be a snap, I'm going for technical management positions. While these
						jobs are more difficult to snag, they may be a better fit for my
						peculiar qualifications.
					</p>
					<p>
						And in the meantime, I'm trying to write a requiem for my father.
						While at music school, I promised him I'd do this. Unfortunately
						I completely forgot this youthful promise, but Dad did not. I'm
						not a composer anymore! But I'll try try try...(and I thought
						making movies was hard).
					</p>
					<p>
						That pretty much catches you up to where I am now. Don't you wish you
						watched tv instead of reading this crap?
