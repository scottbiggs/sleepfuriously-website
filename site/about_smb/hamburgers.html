				<div class="text">
					<p>
						First of all, what qualifies as a hamburger?
					</p>
				</div>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Just Austin
						<p>
							I'm not gonna talk about anywhere other than what I know.
							To do otherwise would just be stupid
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Less than $8.00
						<p>
							Hamburgers are pretty simple food: they're essentially
							a meal you can carry. In my mind, anything that costs
							more than eight dollars is a chopped steak sandwich.
							Yeah, the limit is pretty arbitrary;
							feel free to complain <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en/contact_us/restaurant_feedback.html" target="_newtab">here</a> if you don't like it.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Try each three times
						<p>
							Consistency is the essence of this food. So many things
							can change over time, that this is <em>essential</em>.
							I won't rate anything without trying it at least thrice.
							Also, I'll try to keep at the ones that are already rated
							to make sure they're still in the right place.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Beef only
						<p>
							This is for my sanity. There are so many varieties with
							beef alone that I'm way over my head. Include all the
							other patties and I might as well start reviewing
							sandwiches (which would be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">Sisyphean</a> effort).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						Cheese?
						<p>
							To me, cheese is a matter of preference. The term
							"hamburger" includes cheeseburgers, which is simply a
							more specific term. In general I like both quite a bit.
							But some special concoctions would be sorely off
							without that unique cheese.
						</p>

				<div class="biggest">da List</div>
				<ol>
					<li><a href="http://www.casinoelcamino.net/" target="_newtab">Casino el Camino</a></li>
					<p>
						These burgers have always been amazing: somewhere around 3/4 pounds of high-quality
						beef cooked <em>just right</em>. While the cooks are surly and the
						wait is much longer than you expect, the quality of the hamburgers
						are without peer in this town. All the varieties I've tasted were
						tops in the city. Wow!
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.hopdoddy.com/" target="_newtab">hopdoddy burger bar</a></li>
					<p>
						A relative new-comer to Austin, but daaaamn! Their regular burger
						is pretty good, but some of their specialties are sublime. I
						particularly like the Terlingua, Goodnight, and Diablo burgers.

					</p>
					<p>
						Both locations are super-popular, which means standing in line
						almost as long as you'd wait at the Casino el Camino (which has
						a much cooler atmosphere).
						Also, with popularity comes a rise in burger prices. They might
						be shut out of this list soon.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.fuddruckers.com/" target="_newtab">Fuddruckers</a></li>
					<p>
						As much as I hate to admit, a chain restaurant sits comfortably
						in third place. But I gotta be honest to myself and the world:
						Fuddruckers makes damn good hamburgers. And if you're creative
						with the fixin's (and they give you plenty of choices), you can
						easily make a sublime burger.
					</p>
					<p>
						Their meat is pretty high quality with the right amount of fat.
						The buns are toasted very nicely and do the job of holding a giant burger in
						place without getting in the way. And you can even make a salad
						on your plate for free (mayo + A1 + hot sauce = salad dressing)!
					</p>
					<p>
						Inexplicably, all the Fuddruckers in Austin closed simultaneously,
						but one can still be found on I-35 in Round Rock and somewhere
						in Oak Hill (or so I've been told). <strong>Update</strong>: Found a
						Fuddruckers near Cedar Park in the <em>Lakecreek Mall</em> area on 620.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://hpbng.com/" target="_newtab">Hyde Park Bar & Grill</a></li>
					<p>
						At the fork in the road since I was in high school, this place
						has been making excellent hamburgers. The quality has dropped in
						the past year or so, causing them to move from 2nd to 4th place.
						Still, I can highly
						recommend these burgers as long as you specify (and insist once
						they arrive) at medium-rare (their standard medium is dry).
					</p>
					
					<li><a href="http://twistedrootburgerco.com/" target="_newtab">Twisted Root</a></li>
					<p>
						A Dallas chain that's quickly expanding, they did a really cute
						job with their first Austin location. And they did an excellent job
						converting an abandoned fast-food joint into a hip and comfortable 
						place to eat and hang out. Not only did they manage to make an
						outdoor bar that's pleasant even on ugly-ass Burnet Road, but they
						added some mini-golf for the kids too. Lots of attention to little
						details throughout make Twisted Root a particularly pleasant and
						interesting place.
					</p>
					<p>
						The burgers are juicy with a good char. The menu choices
						are creative and tasty.
						And their meat selection is the best I've seen anywhere.
						Don't forget to sample their pickle bar (which inched Twisted Root above
						Smash Burger)!
						Shakes are over-rated (small and lacking good flavor definition).
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://smashburger.com/" target="_newtab">Smash Burger</a></li>
					<p>
						Yet another chain has leapt into Austin and surprised me by
						their high quality!
						The friendly folks running the franchise in the Mueller development
						have consistently put out delicious burgers. Extremely similar
						quality to Twisted Root, I have always been very pleased with
						the juicy and tasty hamburgers they serve.
					</p>
					<p>
						I only hope this place survives. It's location is not that good,
						and their advertising is minimal. While they have all the tax
						breaks of being in Mueller (that's another story!), it doesn't
						look like they're raking in the bucks that a big corporation
						expects from a franchise. Another possibility is that they may
						lower their burger quality <span class="shudder">shudder</span>.
					</p>
					

					<li><a href="http://thefriscoaustin.com/" target="_newtab">The Frisco</a></li>
					<p>
						Both burgers, the Down South and The Frisco are excellent and
						completely satisfying. But the quality has diminished since their
						move from the super-funky-cool-sixties place to their new location.
						I don't get it; the people working there convinced me that everything
						is exactly the same, but the hamburgers are simply a notch lower
						than before. Perhaps they upgraded their equipment to something
						that's not quite as hot because the char (which creates the coveted
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction" target="_newtab">Maillard reaction</a>)
						isn't quite like before.
					</p>

					<li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Denny's/@30.2765432,-97.729755,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x4d35d81df1fc5276"
					 target="_newtab">Denny's at 1601 I-35 N</a></li>
					<p>
						Notice that this is location specific. This particular Denny's is
						where they train managers. Consequently it's an excellent restaurant
						with brilliant hambugers. Go ahead, try it; they're open right now.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://hutsfrankandangies.com/" target="_newtab">Hut's Hamburgers</a></li>
					<p>
						Finally made it to Chronicle's fave. This has been around
						for a long time, and is pretty good. Nice selection of special
						burgers. And if you like giant onion rings, this is the place.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.nausdrug.com/" target="_newtab">Nau's Enfield Drug</a></li>
					<p>
						Only open for lunch, but very nice. This place hasn't changed much
						in many decades, which is what makes it so sweet. The service can
						be swift or slumberly--haven't figured out what makes the difference.
						But the burgers are always worth it.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://mightyfineburgers.com/" target="_newtab">Mighty Fine</a></li>
					<p>
						Yeah, another chain, I know. When first opened, the burgers were
						surprisingly good. But as time passed and the thrill of novelty
						wears off, the burgers have declined slightly in quality. But you
						<em>can</em> specify the done-ness (perfect medium rare last time--made a
						big difference).
					</p>
					<p>
						However, they have some of the best french fries in town (seriously!),
						and the only thing better than their lemonade is their strawberry lemonade!
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.texadelphia.com/" target="_newtab">Texadelphia</a></li>
					<p>
						Ah, memories of scrambling for lunch at UT. I couldn't afford the
						cheese-steak, so I always got their burger (to go, to avoid the
						enormous line for a seat). The brothers running the place always
						remembered my name and how I liked my burger.
					</p>
					<p>
						The original place on the Drag just closed, but the other locations
						are pretty tasty, just not as memory-evocative. I know that cheese-steak
						looks great (and it is!), but  go ahead and give the burger a chance;
						you'll be pleasantly surprised.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.dartbowl.com/" target="_newtab">Dart Bowl</a></li>
					<p>
						Hidden over to the right side (as you enter) is a greasy little
						restaurant. And you'll see that most of the patrons are not bowling;
						that's a good sign. While most are enjoying the enchiladas (they lace
						them with crack!), the hamburgers are quite good, too.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.centralmarket.com/Home" target="_newtab">Central Market</a></li>
					<p>
						Yes, this souped-up HEB at Lamar & 38th makes a damn good hamburger.
						One would hope so, as we know where they get their raw ingredients!
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.billysonburnet.com/" target="_newtab">Billy's on Burnet</a></li>
					<p>
						Don't know what started me going there, but I usually enjoy one of
						their hamburgers while watching a Packer's game with Wisconsin
						expats. And do you know what? their veggie burger is almost as
						good as the real thing!
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.fiveguys.com/" target="_newtab">Five Guys Burgers and Fries</a></li>
					<p>
						This chain is fairly new to Austin. I am pleased that all their
						additions (nice selection) are gratis, allowing enormous customization
						to your burger. And if you're really hungry, you can fill up on
						peanuts while waiting (kind of odd).
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.pterrys.com/" target="_newtab">P. Terry's Burger Stand</a></li>
					<p>
						An Austin favorite, and easily the best of the drive-thru burgers,
						P. Terry's was one of the first to certify (and advertise) that
						their food is all-natural. Think: what if Whole Foods ran a fast-food
						burger joint. And it's all quite good, too.
					</p>

					<p>
						One of the last of the old national Sandy's chain, for decades this place has
						been a popular stop-off after a day at Barton Springs.
						I usually go for the soft-serve ice cream (screw that tasteless white
						defecation from Dairy Queen!), but the burgers are good, hot, and will
						make an excellent meal for the hungry swimmer.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.dans-hamburgers.com/" target="_newtab">Dan's</a> and <a href="http://franshamburgers.com/" target="_newtab">Fran's</a> Hamburgers</li>
					<p>
						Thanks to a divorce, we now have two chains of high quality inexepensive
						hamburgers in Austin. I can't tell a difference between the two, but I
						do enjoy them thanks to their plentiful locations and hard-to-beat price.
					</p>

					<li><a href="http://www.philsicehouse.com/" target="_newtab">Phil's Icehouse</a></li>
					<p>
						Barely good enough for this list, I only include Phil's because of the
						nice variety, very good fries (regular, sweet potato, or half/half),
						and the fantastic ice cream six paces away. While flavorful, the burgers are consistently
						over-cooked, dry, and rubbery.

					Here lie the remains of excellent hamburger joints who have

					remain.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mike's Pub</li>
					<p>
						The Poster Child for diamond-in-the-rough restaurants,
						this greasy dive was located in the stairway of a parking
						garage downtown. Great tasting greasy burgers.
					</p>

					<li>The Hub</li>
					<p>Hidden in the hills of West Austin just off 2222, the friendly
						staff made a number of exceptional burgers. And their burger &
						Dom Perignon special was an oddity of high proportions.
					</p>
					<p><em>Interesting note</em>: you could choose you burger as "Fatty"
						or "Flatty." At first this just seems like an easy way to distinguish
						the quarter pound from the half pound burger (approximately), but
						there's considerably more to this issue. The fatter the burger, the
						more time the cook has to develop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">
						Maillard Reaction</a> on the burger's surface without drying out
						the inside. I'll write some more on this in the future--promise!
					</p>


					<a href="#" onClick="jkpopimage('images/md&b_menu.jpg', 530, 445, 'Mad Dog & Beans menu.'); return false">
						<img class="float_right" src="images/md&b_menu_th.jpg" alt="mad dog & beans menu" />
					</a>
					<li>Mad Dog & Beans</li>
					<p>
						Long gone, but not forgotten, Mad Dog & Beans was an institution
						for UT students and hippies alike for a long time. This small
						wooden-porch building a stone's throw from the Drag hosted perfectly
						charred hand-formed patties with good variations were always
						satisfying and well-loved. Add a Blue Bell ice-cream shake
						(about half a dozen flavors) and you're in heaven. Oh yeah,
						they used large steak-style fries.
					</p>
					<p>
						Their hot-dogs were split and served on hamburger buns. The
						burgers were so good that I rarely tried them, but I remember
						that the chili-dog (Mad Dog's Dog) was pretty tasty.
						Oddly, their beans weren't that good.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mad Dog & Beans closed many years ago, but was beloved. Too bad the
						owners screwed their employees by not paying the IRS their
						income tax (which caused the shut-down). Fuckers.
					</p>
					<div class="clear"> </div>

					<li>GM Steakhouse</li>
					<p>Long an Austin staple (started in 1962), the last GM Steakhouse
						closed its doors in 2006. The original location on the south side of
						the Drag was famous for its great cheeseburgers and in-your-face attitude.
						For example, cheeseburgers were something like $1.95, yet cheeseburgers-without-the-cheese
						were $2.15; "Hamburger" was a forbidden word, and anyone using it was subject
						to ridicule. Of course, you'd proably be made fun of anyway just for going there.
						Students loved it!
					</p>
					<li>Holiday House</li>
					<p>Opened in 1947, several of these populated Austin, each decorated (interior
						and exterior) in a particular holiday theme. The one on Airport, near my house
						was a steep A-frame building made to look like a tropical hut with real
						anchors in the parking lot. Inside were were several aquariums (salt water!)
						and plenty of Polynesian items. One had an alligator and other animals, and
						I seem to barely recall one has a western theme.
					</p>
					<p>The hamburgers were all "Flame-Kissed," meaning they were cooked on a grill
						over a fire instead of in a pan or on a griddle. This gave a great char
						on the patties and let excess fat drip off (allowing a higher fat content
						beef).
					</p>

					<li>El Arroyo's Cuban Burger</li>

						item. Too bad, as this was #3 on my list! Some idiot
						shelved an A+ hamburger! Sigh.

					<li>Drungo Ice House</li>
					<p>
						Every town has spots where restaurants just can't succeed,
						and Drungo was at one of those locations (29th & Rio Grande).
						This short-lived bar & grill had an excellent
						burger. Extra high quality veggies, well-toasted buns,
						and cooked at a properly high temperature gave a great hamburger.
						The <a href="#">photo</a> at the top of this page is a Drungo
						cheeseburger.

					There are some burgers that I wish I hadn't eaten.  The memorable
					ones are here.  And yes, chopped-steak sandwiches are included
					as well. Few things are as disappointing as spending a lot of
					money on a "hambuger" and having wished you went to Dan's instead.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Vince Young's Steakhouse</li>
					<p>
						I like Vince Young. I like his steakhouse as well. To my
						knowledge, it's the only non-chain prime-quality steak place
						in town. The food pretty much is as rich as you'd expect for
						a top-dollar joint downtown.
					</p>
					<p>
						And I know I said that I try everything thrice.  But $23
						is too much to pay to suffer through their hamburger more
						than once.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hungry for a really good chopped-steak sandwich (ie expensive
						hamburger), I wandered in and sat at the bar. The
						friendly and attentive staff took my order for a "Wagyu Brisket
						Burger. I was immediately skeptical, but the bartender insisted
						that brisket provides a greater flavor and made a delicious
						burger.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here in Texas, we <strong>know</strong> brisket. Barbecue
						brisket was invented just twenty minutes from my
						house (<a href="https://www.kreuzmarket.com/" target="_newtab">Kreuz'</a>).
						Brisket has lots of connective tissue, which explains why
						it's such a cheap cut of meat despite its full flavor. Low
						and slow cooking gelatinizes the tendons, creating something
						wonderful: Texas bbq brisket.
					</p>
					<p>
						But hamburgers are cooked hot and quick. And even though this
						place starts with the most tender beef in the world, a quick
						burger sear combined with a coarse grind yielded a pile of
						inedible beef tissue on my plate. At times I thought I was
						chewing beef-flavored gum.
					</p>
					<p>
						I can't see how they can fix this problem. Brisket is a
						<em>terrible</em> idea for a hamburger! What were they thinking?
