				A Safe Place To Experiment
			</div>
			<p>You have been acting for years, you know what you're
				doing, and you feel comfortable performing. You have
				a well-tested repertoire and can pull items from
				it easily. Your instincts are generally on-the-money,
				and your home runs are as frequent as your fails are rare.
			</p>
			
			<p>Yes, you are an advanced actor. Congratulations on achieving
				proficiency at a surprisingly difficult art! The Actor's
				Gym is a great place to practice and maintain your skills.
			</p>
			
			<p>The Actor's Gym is more than a place to maintain, it's
				a place to stretch and strengthen rarely-used muscles.
				With the philosophy of "Likes and Adds Only," you
				can experiment with new sides of yourself without
				worry.
			</p>
				
			<p>Above all, the Actor's Gym is a safe place. Negative comments
				and behavior (outside of performances of course!) are simply
				not allowed. We believe that learning happens quickest and
				most efficiently through positive reinforcement and productive
				criticisms.

				What are all these people doing?
			</div>

			<p>You want to act--you've even tried a few plays and made some youtube
				videos. You've heard people talk about acting "techniques," but
				you're kind of at a loss as to what <em>exactly</em> they are
				talking about.
			</p>

			</a>
			
			<p>This class is perfect for you. We start without assuming 
				anything--even the definition of acting! We use instruction
				defined by <a target="_newtab" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Boleslawski">Richard
				Boleslavsky</a>'s book, which teaches straight-forward acting techniques
				without any mumbo-jumbo.
			</p>
			<p>The techniques you
				learn in this class will provide the tools to fully engage
				as an actor and gain a solid understanding of the acting
				craft.
