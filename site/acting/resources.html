				You want content? Ho-boy, you got it!
			</div>
			<p>Here you'll find all sorts of goodies! You'll find a glossary of terms,
				links to useful websites, books to read, movies to study, and anything
				else we think may be useful.</p>
			<p>But first, I must point out a book that is sorely overlooked. If you
			have ever wondered, "Exactly <em>what</em> is everyone talking about when
			they say 'Simple Acting Skills,' 'Techniques,' or 'Basic Preparation?'"
			this is the book for you.
			<a target="_newtab" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Boleslawski">Richard
			Boleslavsky</a> wrote a charming little
			thing that will take the brashest beginner and get him heading in the
			right direction.</p>

			<p>But whether you're a beginner or not, I use a bunch of terms all the
			time. Do yourself a favor and check 'em out.

				Definitions
			</div>
			<div class="deck">
				These terms provide a language to discuss the difficult
				and touchy realm of the acting arts. Know them, use them,
				love them.
			</div>
			<p>
				Most of these definitions were first introduced to me by
				<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852023/?ref_=tt_ov_wr">Ben Taylor</a>
				during his workshops in Austin, Texas. He expanded upon and greatly improved

				(check out his book,
				<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.actingstudiochicago.com/guideposts.html"><span class="underline">Audition</span></a>).
				I have no idea how anyone can teach or even talk about acting without such a vocabulary!
			</p>

			<ul class="def_list">
				<li id="attraction"><div class="def">Attraction / Repulsion</div>
					<p>It's possible (and useful) to see every line as falling
					into one of these two categories. You must at least understand
					what you're trying to convey to have any hope of conveying it!</p>
					<p class="try">Find the line in
					each scene that most epitomizes Attraction or Repulsion, and
					then deliver it reversed (see <a href="#otn">on the nose</a>.)</p>
				</li>

				<li id="bring"><div class="def">Bring the Audience In (to You)</div>
					<p>Yes, this is a matter of intent, but it creates large
					differences in your acting that can be easily seen. You want the audience to be
					connected to your performance, so you reach out to them,
					pushing your performance outward to reach the back of the
					theater. But that is a <a href="#trap">trap</a>; it's much better to <strong>Bring the
					Audience to You</strong>.</p>
					<p>Sometimes we try too hard as actors. We push our performance <em>to</em>
					the audience instead of simply
					Bringing the Audience In.
					Of course, Projecting your acting (not your voice which should <em>always</em>
					be projected!) may be necessary in large theaters, but in film
					and intimate theaters it'll ruin
					a performance.</p>
					<p>Generally, when someone looks like "they're <em>acting</em>,"
					it's because they are not Bringing the Audience In. They are
					bringing their acting to the audience.</p>
					<p>By keeping our acting close and Bringing the Audience to You,
					the specatators are roped into your space,
					creating a vastly more intimate experience -- the kind that
					will be appreciated and remembered.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="choices"><div class="def">Choices</div>
					<p>This is the hard part, the <strong>choices</strong> you make
					as an artist is what seperates art from everything else. So of
					course it will take effort. It is <em>your</em> choices that make
					your performance yours and yours alone.</p>
					<p>The only way to make sure that you make good, creative, and
					fascinating choices is to make them <em>consciously</em>, with
					plenty of deliberation and care. Your first choice is usually a
					<a href="#trap">trap</a>; spend a few seconds and come up with something
					better!</p>
					<p class="try">Always have at least five choices in your pocket for
					every scene. By being aware of all the choices
					you make, it's easy to change your choices--something
					that directors will love.</p>
				</li>



				<li id="choreography"><div class="def">Choreography</div>
					<p>What are your goals for this scene?
					How does the space of your scene play into these goals? Make a
					plan to use as much of this space as possible that makes sense
					for your character's goals and execute it.
					<strong>Choreography</strong> is much more than blocking, it is interacting
					with your environment.</p>
					<img class="float_right" src="images/Sweetener-Packets_smaller.jpg" width="187" height="125" />
					<p>This works even if you're locked down. Let's say you're
					forced into staying seated (a boring coffee shop scene--shame
					on the writer!). Even through your butt is glued to a chair,
					you can still grab a packet of sugar from another table (make
					sure to have a good motive!) to sweeten your scene-mate's
					coffee (remember <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>). Even
					the four feet that your arms can reach can and should be choreographed.</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</li>

				<li id="commitment"><div class="def">Commitment</div>
					<p><strong>Commitment</strong> is essentially the ability
					of an actor to go with the role no matter what. Whether it's
					spending all day in a freezing lake pretending it's
					summer-time, playing nude, or simply being chipper and
					pleasant when in truth you have a miserable cold, these
					are all examples of Commitment.</p>
					<p>You need to portray your
					character with complete abandon of your own personal feelings;
					in other words, Commit yourself to the character. Completely.
					And the smaller the role, the more difficult it is. But
					it does makes a difference, and the audience can see it.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="connection"><div class="def">Connection</div>
					<p><strong>Connection</strong> (differentiated from <a href="#consumption">consumption</a> below)
					is when the actors in the scene are aware of and actively respond
					to each other and their environment. In many techniques,
					Connection is the essence of acting.</p>
					<p>
					It's not just connecting to the other actors; remember to connect to the setting,
					the time, the props, even the sounds. Staying connected without
					looking is an easy way to differentiate good actors from passable actors.</p>
					<p class="try">Connect with your scene partner while facing away (perhaps
					you're watching tv, reading a book, doing homework, etc.). Listen with
					your eyes. Respond with your body to each <a href="#darts">dart</a> they throw.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="consumption"><div class="def">Consumption</div>
					<img class="float_right" src="images/consumption two-people-talking_smaller.jpg" />
					<p>This is probably the <span class="underline">most important term</span> here!
						<strong>Consumption</strong> is making the scene <em>about</em> the other person.
						Your job onstage is quite simple: make the other person look as good (as an actor)
						as possible.</p>
					<p>Your friends and classmates might tolerate selfish acting, but trust me,
					they <em>do</em> notice. And eventually they'll start looking for other
					people (those with Consumption) to work with.</p>
					<p>If you happen to be working on-set with a big name, you'll notice that
						most of them act with Consumption naturally. To get where they are, they pretty much
						have to be team players. But if you fail to Consume while working with them,
						you'll soon find yourself replaced.</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</li>

				<li id="convergence"><div class="def">Convergence</div>
					<p>Similar to <a href="#connection">connection</a>, Convergence
					is a bit more specific. <strong>Convergence</strong> is
					where the actors in a scene move towards identical levels
					of energy and goals.</p>
					<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.rangerette.com/"><img class="float_right"
						src="images/rangerettes_small.jpg" /></a>
					<p>In a mythical "perfect" Convergence,
					all the actors would be twins, dressed alike, making the same movements
					at the same time, and speaking in unison (the
					<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.rangerette.com/">Rangerettes</a>
					are a local example). Usually you won't want to go this far,
					but keep Convergence in mind and keep it in your arsenal as
					it's an easy way to maintain <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>
					and can heighten feelings of collaboration.</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</li>

				<li id="darts"><div class="def">Darts (Poison, Throwing, Receiving)</div>
					<img class="float_right" src="images/blue-dart_small.jpg" />
					<p>A <strong>Dart</strong> is a communication that: 1) intends
					to create a strong effect, 2) has specific target(s),
					and 3) also makes a deep impression on the audience.</p>
					<p>Thus Actors have the responsibility to make sure that
					their thrown darts are easily perceived. And the receiver
					(target) of the dart must make it known that they were hit.
					If either are missing, then the audience will probably miss
					it too.</p>
					<p>The <strong>Poison Dart</strong> is the moment in every good
					scene that changes the course of the story irrevocably. Do your
					research, find that Poison Dart, and make it stick!</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</li>

				<li id="db"><div class="def">DB</div>
					<p>
						DB is short for <strong>Do Better</strong>. As an actor, there are so
						many things to think about, we often miss something. DB is a
						reminder to work on something you may have overlooked.
					</p>
					<p>
						It does not mean that what you
						have done is not good. Quite the contrary, DB means that
						what you did is ok, but we know that you can do better.
						And DBs are always very specific, such as: "Change your <a href="#spm">SPM</a>
						when delivering your line", or "Your opening <a href="#pictures">picture</a>
						can be more effective."

					</p>
				</li>

				<li id="director_proof"><div class="def">Director Proof</div>
					<p>Be prepared. Show up on set with specific and unique choices.
					Execute as if your choices were carved in stone. Don't leave
					any unanswered questions (find answers to any questions that
					the script throws at you, the performer, long before stepping
					on set).</p>
					<p>Directors are much busier than you can imagine, so don't
					expect them to guide you through every line. If you haven't
					a clue as to how to portray your role, it will show in your
					performance as the director probably won't have time to help. With strong
					choices and confident performances you make the director's life
					easy, which she <em>will</em> remember.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="divergence"><div class="def">Divergence</div>
					<p>The opposite of <a href="#convergence">convergence</a>,
					<strong>Divergence</strong> is where you and your scene-mates
					are moving in different, often opposite, directions. Conflict,
					the essence of dramatic interest, often motivates characters
					to Diverge from one another. Good writers do this naturally;
					audiences love it.</p>
					<p>While Divergence is quite difficult to portray, do not fall
					into the <a href="#trap">trap</a> of focusing inward, concentrating on your character's
					goals. This will make your performance selfish and boring to watch.
					The secret to pulling off Divergence is to be <em>even more <a href="#consumption">consumed</a></em>!
					Why is your scene-mate <em>not</em> agreeing with you? Work harder
					to get them on your side (or respond stronger to get them to <em>stop</em>
					-- see <a href="#attraction">repulsion</a>). The strange truth is that
					<strong>Divergence actually requires more consumption</strong> than
					Convergence!</p>
				</li>

				<li id="discovery"><div class="def">Discovery</div>
					<p>The audience needs to know when your character discovers
					new information. Related to receiving <a href="#darts">darts</a>,
					<strong>Discovery</strong> cues viewers into knowing that
					<em>you</em> (the character) just learned or figured something
					out.</p>
					<p>This is not about finding buried treasure or lost keys,
					Discovery is about information and knowledge--what's inside
					your character's head.</p>
					<p class="try">When your character changes her mind, try an
					odd-ball <a href="#spm">SPM</a> instead of the cliché of shifting 
					your head/eyes.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="fighting_loss"><div class="def">Fighting the Loss</div>
					<p>Many actors learn to cry on cue. And use it often.
					The truth is that, trying <em>not</em> to cry is much
					sadder for the audience than watching actual tears (which
					can be cathartic--a release of tension instead of building
					tension).</p>
					<p>You can <strong>Fight the Loss</strong> by doing something
					to hold back the tears: an <a href="#spm">SPM</a>, repulsion,
					even failed humor. Or <a href="#db">DB</a>, come up with some new way.
					Show how to <a href="#turn left">turn left</a> when we think you're going to turn right.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="heart"><div class="def">Heart</div>
					<p><strong>Heart</strong> is essentil, yet difficult to
					define. Heart means to make us care about the character.
					If the writer forgets, it's up to you as an actor to
					supply a reason to cheer/hate/lust/etc for that character;
					the audience MUST care in some way or form!</p>
					<p>Writers have been neglecting Heart for so long that
					audiences (and critics) have stopped insisting on it.
					This takes our craft to new lows, sadly. But you can be
					part of the solution instead of the problem by always
					acting with Heart. And your audiences will cheer <em>you</em>
					for it.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="heat"><div class="def">Heat</div>
					<p>Yes, <strong>Heat</strong> is sexual. But that's just the
					beginning. Heat is strength, Heat is animal, Heat intimidates
					and coerces. Heat is what separates leaders from the pack.
					Heat is thrilling to watch. And
					sadly, Heat has become very rare these days.</p>

					<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082089/" class="float_right">
						<img src="images/body-heat-hurt-turner.jpg" /></a>
					<p>A generation ago, you couldn't get a job in Hollywood without
					Heat. Even nuns like Sally Fields (<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061252/">"The Flying Nun"</a>)
					and
					Julie Andrews had it (<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059742/?ref_=nv_sr_1">"The Sound of Music"</a>).
					And you need to find it, cultivate it, and fearlessly use it.</p>

					<p>One of the best (and most obvious) examples of Heat is Kathleen
					Turner in "<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082089/">Body Heat</a>." Even the normally stoic William Hurt finds
					his animal self and shows real Heat (in one of the sexiest scenes
					in movie history).</p>

					<div class="clear"></div>
				</li>

				<li id="hills"><div class="def">Hills & Valleys</div>
					<p>Each scene has high moments and low moments, even if
					quite subtle. It's the movement between the levels of energy that
					provide interest (as opposed to the <a href="#hum">pleasant hum</a>). 
					It's your job as an actor to analyze
					the scene, find these
					peaks and valleys, and show 'em!</p>
					<p>When the rises and falls are extreme, we use the term
					<a href="#rollercoaster">Rollercoaster</a>. And when we
					fail to achieve any distinction in our scenes, chances are strong that
					someone is <a href="#hitting">hitting the same note on the piano</a>.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="history"><div class="def">History</div>
					<p>Far too often the writer will neglect writing any
					<strong>History</strong> for your character.
					And even when they do, it will never be enough.</p>
					<p>Your job as an actor is to create a History for your character&#8212when they were
					born, where they grew up, who their parents were, all the way
					to what brought them to the scene at that moment.  And it doesn't
					hurt to do this for each character in the scene as well.</p>
					<p class="try">What was the mood
					the last time your characters talked? How long have they
					known each other? How did they meet? Get with your
					scene-mate and answer these questions.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="hitting"><div class="def">Hitting the Same Note on the Piano</div>
					<p>Even the most beautiful musical note in the world will become
					tiresome if that's all you hear. 
					You may have achieved a beautiful picture, moment, or mood for a scene, but you
					must not stay there.
					<strong>Hitting the Same
					Note on the Piano</strong> works against <a href="#hills">hills and valleys</a>
					and is a sure sign that your scene needs work.</p>
					<p>As obvious as this sounds, you'll hear this a lot. The
					fix is usually as simple as doing your homework and
					carefully examining your scene for Hills and Valleys.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="importance"><div class="def">Importance</div>
					<img class="float_left" src="images/important.png" />
					<p>An excellent book, <a target="_newtab" href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Handbook-Actor-Melissa-Bruder/dp/0394744128">A
					Practical Handbook for the Actor</a> (based on <a target="_newtab" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet">David Mamet</a>'s
					acting theory) calls <strong>Importance</strong> the most essential
					aspect of acting. While I think <a href="#consumption">consumption</a> is
					your highest priority, Importance is a close second.</p>
					<p>Importance means that you, the actor, must care <em>passionately</em>
					about what your character is trying to do. Even if it seems trivial or
					below you, you must make it your mission in life to accomplish this goal.
					And if you don't, it'll show in a lackluster performance.</p>
					<p>Successfully applying Importance implies correctly identifying the
					character's goal. If you're playing a pizza delivery girl, your goal
					is <em>not</em> to upstage the lead and steal the scene (that's the
					goal of a hack actor). The character's
					goal could be: 1) get as big a tip as possible, 2) get noticed by someone
					at the party, 3) get the transaction done as quickly as possible--you have
					other customers to deliver, 4) try not to let the person you're talking to
					know you're really too stoned to be driving, etc. etc.!</p>
					<p class="try">Let's say you're cast as a "Victim #3" in a no-budget gore
					movie. You have no lines; you just scream and die from being stabbed. You
					must find a way to scream your heart out! Die like your life depended
					on it (hehe, couldn't resist)! And if you can't do that, don't take the part.
					In class, you have no choice: <em>find</em> a way to make this the
					most Important part you've ever played. Yes, do it!</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</li>

				<li id="like"><div class="def">Likes / Adds</div>
					<p>Change your perception of criticism at the Actor's Gym. "Good" or
					"Bad" are not useful descriptions of a performance. By using
					only <strong>Likes</strong> and <strong>Adds</strong>,
					we not only foster a positive environment, but we force comments
					to be useful and specific.</p>

				<li id="make_every_moment_count"><div class="def">Make Every Moment Count</div>
					<p>If you are standing around, watching other people speak, waiting for
					your cue to say and do something, STOP! You need to <strong>Make
					Every Moment Count</strong>.
					Your time on stage is precious--to you and to the audience.
					Don't waste a second.</p>
					<p class="try">Start with <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>, which will guide
					you 80% of the way, even if you're an usher taking the main character's
					ticket at a theater. Find a way to make that main character look like a
					better actor (by responding <span class="underline">to</span> him, not
					upstaging him).</p>
					<p class="try"><a href="#spm">SPM</a>s will keep you in the scene instead of the
					cutting room floor. If it's especially good, the director may decide
					it's worthy of a close-up.</p>
					<p class="try">Work <em>with</em> other actors to make <a href="#pictures">pictures</a>,
					create <a href="#history">histories</a>, <a href="#plant seeds">plant seeds</a>,
					<a href="#planned accidents">plan accidents</a>, or create a sub-story
					(but always <a href="#serve the script">serve the script</a>).</p>

				</li>

				<li id="stillness"><div class="def">Moments of Stillness</div>
					<p>Every art form has a negative. Sculpture has negative space, music
					has rests. Painting has blank canvas. Acting, like dance, has
					<strong>Moments of Stillness</strong>.</p>
					<p>And as you throw everything you can think of into a scene,
					creating <a href="#pictures">pictures</a>,
					sending us on a wild <a href="#rollercoaster">rollercoaster</a>,
					and serving olympic-caliber <a href="#ping pong">ping pong</a>,
					it's the moments where everything slams to a halt that people
					will remember.</p>
					<p>So don't <em>you</em> forget to use Stillness. (Seven seconds
					is usually the sweet spot.) Caveat: using this too often will ruin
					the effect.</p>
					<p class="try">After your partner answers one of your questions (possibly a 
					<a href="#dart">dart</a>), wait before answering or even moving. Just count
					to seven in your head and then react.
					Your Moment of Stillness will convey the significance for you.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="mystery"><div class="def">Mystery / Secret</div>
					<p>Ben Taylor put this best: <strong>Mystery</strong> is
					"little moments in the performance that make us wonder
					what is really going on inside." The <strong>Secret</strong> is
					the detail that the audience is craving to find out. You can plant
					these in your performance through <a href="#spm">SPM</a>s or simply
					responding unexpectedly
					(<a href="#turn left">turn left when we think you'll turn
					right</a>).</p>
					<p>Mystery is the opposite of <a href="#otn">on the nose</a>,
					and is one of many possible cures for that malady. The audience
					will get bored if they know what's going to happen. Add some
					Mystery and Secrets to keep 'em guessing--and watching.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="otn"><div class="def">On the Nose (OTN)</div>
					<p>Once you understand <strong>On the Nose</strong>,
					you'll start seeing it everywhere. You may even lose respect
					for some scripts and performances that you used to
					think was just fine. That's a good thing; it means
					you're learning to discriminate--essential for
					improvement.</p>
					<p>When a line means <em>exactly</em> what it says,
					that's On the Nose. And nine times out of ten OTN
					lines are superfluous. But as an actor, you don't
					often have the ability to change or cut lines, so
					you're forced to say something that's written On the Nose.</p>
					<p>But you don't have to do it like that (like everyone
					else). Please please please consider saying it another way--any
					other way! Good actors naturally do this when given OTN
					lines.</p>
					<p>Of course, if you play your line well, avoiding OTN, and
					the director asks you to play it On the Nose, you are now
					relieved of your obligation and must perform as directed.
					If you feel it's very important, you may discuss this in private with the
					director (never make a director look bad in front of the
					crew!). There may be extenuating circumstances in the
					script that you aren't aware of.
					</p>
					<p class="try">The most OTN line is, "I love you." It also
					violates the first rule of screen-writing (show it, don't
					say it). Your job, when you see this line, is to find
					another way to say it that means something besides, "I love
					you." Try Irony, Sarcasm, Fear, Hesitation, Domination,
					Frustration, Uncertainty, etc. -- anything to make this line no
					longer OTN. As a good actor, you must be better than the written
					words.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="otherside"><div class="def">Other Side of Self</div>
					<p>This is one of the very best parts of acting, using

					opposite sex-hunk Burt Reynolds.
					By showing these Other Sides of Self, Fields broke her
					restrictive type-casting and won more awards than you can
					shake a stick at.</p>

				<li id="overlap"><div class="def">Overlapping Dialog</div>
					<p>Don't be afraid to <strong>Overlap Dialog</strong>. When actors are
					<a href="#consumption">consumed</a>, Overlapping appears natural and authentic. When not consumed,
					the scene will be muddy and confusing. You must also consider the
					amount of Overlapping Dialog: the more you overlap, the more
					heightened the excitement/energy is perceived.
					As you guess, constant Overlapping Dialog
					becomes <a href="#hitting">hitting the same note on the
					piano</a>.</p>
					<p><a target="_newtab" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman">Robert Altman</a> is a master of Overlapping Dialog. While
					you can watch any of his movies and see plenty, I recommend
					one of his earlier films,
					"<a target="_newtab" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASH_(film)">M*A*S*H</a>."
					There is an early scene
					where at least half a dozen people are carrying on multiple conversations.
					And it makes perfect sense!</p>
				</li>

				<li id="pictures"><div class="def">Pictures (Opening / Closing)</div>
					<img class="float_left" src="images/shin_knee_valley_smaller.jpg" />
					<p>As my mentor, Ben Taylor said, "Much as I love the art of good
					dialogue,
					visuals really are what we remember in film a lot of the time....
					<strong>Pictures</strong> are basically moments that lend themselves to being filmed
					just as they are, physical manifestations that tell us more than any
					words could or enhance the ones that are there.  They must be honest
					and inherent to what's going on, and they must
					be there, period."</p>
					<p>I highly recommend following Ben's advice; make
					Pictures in every scene you're in. Pay particular attention to
					the beginning and the end of scenes. Make the Opening Picture grab
					the audiences attention, and make the Closing Picture memorable.
					</p>
					<img class="float_right" src="images/elderly-woman-tired-smaller.jpg" />
					<p class="try">Even if you're locked down: turn, twist, raise your arms,
					alter your clothing, manipulate props (or hair), be <em>doing</em> something (preferably relevant) that
					someone can immediate recognize and remember. It's astonishing all
					the things you can do with your body. For close-ups remember that
					your face is your primary canvas; paint a picture with it!</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>

				<li id="pingpong"><div class="def">Ping Pong</div>
					<p>Finding the right rhythms is the art of <strong>Ping
					Pong</strong>.
					Sometimes you need to play defense and just tap back. Sometimes
					you need to sieze the opportunity and slam. And sometimes things
					get so fast you're running on pure reflex. As an actor, you play
					Ping Pong by working with the rhythms of the scene.</p>
					<p>To contrast with <a href="#swinging">swinging</a> where you and
					your scene-mate augment each other, Ping Pong plays off your scene-mate
					with divergence. Respond to her actions appropriately for your
					character's interests. You use <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>
					and <a href="#connection">connection</a> to find your Ping Pong
					rhythms -- otherwise the meaning
					becomes hollow, and the audience's attention is lost.</p>
					<p>Watch Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant in <a target="_newtab" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032599/">His Girl Friday</a> for
					Ping Pong at its finest.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="seeds"><div class="def">Plant Seeds</div>
					<p><strong>Planting Seeds</strong> means throwing a tidbit to the
					audience that will be used later. <a href="#mystery">Secrets</a> are
					a specific type of Seed, planted to cultivate mystery. If the dialog
					doesn't supply any seeds, make one yourself using props, the environment,
					your scene-mate, and <a href="#spm">SPM</a>s.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="accidents"><div class="def">Planned Accidents</div>
					<p>A specific type of <a href="#spm">SPM</a>, <strong>Planned
					Accidents</strong> are a stumble, knocking over a glass and
					catching it, or
					some other movement that looks like you barely avoided catastrophe, but is really
					very carefully planned (and happens every take!). To work, Planned
					Accidents must be natural and effortless, but they must also
					add to the scene and not distract from your scene-mates (remember
					<a href="#consumption">consumption</a>!).</p>
					<p class="try">Use a Planned Accident to create a <a href="#pictures">picture</a>,
					to emphasize <a href="#hills">hills and valleys</a>, or to
					show create <a href="#wins">wins or losses</a>.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="hum"><div class="def">The Pleasant Hum</div>
					<p>This is something to be avoided.
				</li>

				<li id="rewrite"><div class="def">Rewrite</div>
					<p>Writers have a very difficult job: creating stories and
					worlds. Actors, because of their intimate connection to
					their characters, often have much better ideas for dialog
					than writers can imagine.
					Therefore, you must <strong>Rewrite</strong> to make the line
					better, but you must do so <span class="underline">without
					changing a single letter</span>.</p>
					<p>The vast majority of these terms are ways to do this.
					If you have direct blessing of the writer <em>and</em> the
					director, go ahead and change the lines. But those are the
					exceptions. Use these skills and techniques to accomplish
					those Rewrites.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="risk"><div class="def">Risk</div>
					<p>Simply put, <strong>Risk</strong> is challenging yourself
					and the audience in ways that are probably uncomfortable.
					This means taking chances and above all, stop playing it
					safe!</p>
					<p>This can apply not only to your own performance, but to
					your choice of roles and the character itself.
					What are the Risks he is taking?
					How can you reveal the danger? The answer usually involves
					you, the actor, taking risks in your performance as well.</p>
					<p>Great examples of risk-taking abound. And they are usually
					tied up with <a href="#commitment">commitment</a>. A very
					famous example would be Malcolm McDowell in "A Clockwork
					Orange."</p>
				</li>

				<li id="rollercoaster"><div class="def">Rollercoaster</div>
					<img class="float_left" src="images/Fujiyama-roller-coaster2_smaller.jpg" alt="rollercoaster" />
					<p><strong>Rollercoaster</strong> is simply <a href="#hills">hills
					and valleys</a> racheted up a notch plus some twists and turns.
					The moves from high
					to low and high again should be fast, wild, and thrilling. Not
					to be used throughout an entire scene (which would be exhausting
					to watch), you can Rollercoaster with your scene-mate at key
					moments to make your scene unforgettable.</p>
					<p>See <a href="#spider">Spider and Wasp</a> for a specific type of Rollercoaster.</p>
					<div class="clear"> </div>
				</li>

				<li id="seamless"><div class="def">Seamless</div>
					<p><strong>Seamless</strong>
					is an absolute <em>must</em> for all your performances.
					The audience should never, not even for a split
					second, see that you're acting. A Seamless performance
					never shows that you're concerned about a line, blocking,
					waiting for a cue,
					aware of the camera/audience, or are trying to do a lot
					of things at once (which you are!).</p>
					<p>A Seamless performance looks effortless. But we know it's
					really the result of a lot of practice, preparation, and concentration.
					So hard. So necessary.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="sense_of_place"><div class="def">Sense of Place</div>
					<p>In a movie, the crew works very hard to make the scene
					really look like where it is. If the scene is in an amusement
					park, they will shoot in an amusement park (or spend a lot of
					money reconstructing an amusement park). In theater, the
					actors have to sell the audience on the illusion of the location.
					In other words, you must have a <strong>Sense of Place</strong>
					that's strong enough to make the audience believe you are actually
					there instead of on a stage, acting.</p>
					<p>Establishing this Sense of Place works even better in film
					as the rich environment provides even more opportunities to
					convince the viewer of the location.</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>modulating your voice</dt>
						<dd>Think of how differently you'd speak in a church versus
						a dance club.</dd>

						<dt>posture</dt>
						<dd>How you sit/stand/walk depends not just on what your
						character is going through, but also on where you are. Guys,
						suck in that gut while walking on the beach. Ladies, do you sit straighter
						around your mother than your friends?</dd>

						<dt>responding to the environment</dt>
						<dd>If the setting is crowded, at least acknowledge that
						others are around. Consider interacting with extras, playing
						with props (be sure to ask the prop mistress/master first!),
						or at least <em>look</em> at the stuff on the set.</dd>

						<dt>off-camera</dt>
						<dd>The Sense of Place doubly applies to any object or person
						you must interact with that is out of the shot. For close ups,
						ask the director exactly where the other people/things in the shot should
						be (good directors will have them placed, even for your close ups).
						And now that you know where they are, be <a href="#consumption">consumed</a>
						with them!</dd>

				</li>

				<li id="joy"><div class="def">Shared Moments of Joy</div>
					<p>This technique is so effective that I can't believe it's not
					taught everywhere and practiced all the time. <strong>Shared
					Moments of Joy</strong> are those little things that differentiate
					between a strong performance and an unforgettable performance.</p>
					<p>In the bitterest fight between a couple there is still some sort
					of common ground. And you as an actor must find it, even for a moment, or
					else the performance is <a href="#hitting">hitting the same note on the
					piano</a>. We need to see those <a href="#hills">hills and valleys</a>
					to keep from becoming bored from repetition.</p>
					<p>And during one of those lulls, a good writer may plant something
					small that you as an actor may use for a Shared Moment of Joy.</p>
					<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.julieharrisphotography.com/blog/2010/04/10/danielle-and-andrew/danielle-and-andrew-9572/">
						<img class="float_right" src="images/joy.jpg" alt="shared moments of joy"/></a>
					<p>And this goes for all sorts of scenes: the football team that is playing
					a far superior foe finally makes a first down; the class clown gets
					a key concept (shared moment between the class clown and the teacher);
					a woman in a suit smiles at a homeless man holding a sign asking for
					pot.</p>
					<p class="try">The key is that the Shared Moment of Joy should be planned, should be done without a
					hint of irony (see <a href="#heart">heart</a>), is the result of
					<a href="#convergence">convergence</a> and <a href="#connection">connection</a>,
					and embodies <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="slow_burn"><div class="def">Slow Burn</div>
					<p>Sort of a combination of <a href="#heat">heat</a> and <a href="#stillness">moments of stillness</a>,
					the <strong>Slow Burn</strong>
					tells you to let the emotions take their sweet time before bursting
					to the surface.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="spider"><div class="def">Spider & Wasp</div>
					<img class="float_left" src="images/battle-to-the-death2.jpg" alt="spider and wasp fighting" />
					<p>When the spider and the wasp fights, sometimes the spider wins, sometimes
					the wasp wins. We don't know until the fight is over. That keeps us on
					edge, participating in the drama of the situation. And that makes good acting.</p>
					<p>So when someone suggests that a scene needs more <strong>Spider and Wasp</strong>,
					they want the actors to keep the audience in more suspence about the outcome.
					Work harder to make the participants equally likely to prevail. And show us
					the fight!</p>
					<p>Note that this is a special case of <a href="#rollercoaster">Rollercoaster</a>.</p>
					<div class="clear"></div>
				</li>

				<li id="spm"><div class="def"8>SPM</div>
					<p><strong>SPMs</strong> or <strong>Specific Physical Movements</strong> cannot
					be over-emphasized! SPMs <em>make</em> a character novel and unique, and you
					can do them without a word. A perfect SPM takes a character with no dialog
					and makes her essential to a scene. Learn to make SPMs a natural and automatic
					part of your acting, and make them consistent so the editor/continutity people
					won't go crazy.</p>
					<p>To quote <a target="_newtab" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0852023/?ref_=tt_ov_wr">Ben Taylor</a>
					(again):
					<p class="quote">These [SPMs] are the tiny mannerisms that look accidental and
					aren't.... It's
					what you do with that wine glass in your hand, it's whether you take that
					piece of pizza and if you just pick at it (and then quickly drop it back
					out of scene so you don't have to keep up with it in continuity).  It's the
					biting of the nails, the scratching of the nose, the unique pictures you
					bring even when you're sitting down and it's just your head on an audition tape.</p>
					</p>
					<p class="try">Learn to walk through your life with an internal mirror, noticing all those
					SPMs you do in everyday life. How do you wipe your nose, scratch, prepare to
					sit?  What do you do when waiting at the check-out line? And <em>watch</em>
					other people around you, especially during those moments when (they think) no
					one's watching. Be a sponge, absorb, remember, and then reproduce during your
					acting.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="surprises"><div class="def">Surprises</div>
					<p><strong>Surprises</strong> are simply another way of saying
					<a href="#turn left">turn left</a> when we think you're going to turn right.
					You'll often hear this: "I'd like to see more surprises." That means to turn
					on your creative cap and get thinking.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="swinging"><div class="def">Swinging</div>
					<p>While others use this term differently, I use <strong>swinging</strong> to
					be fully engaged in the moments of the scene. Use the setting, the props, and
					especially the other actors as inspiration. The more you swing, the more the
					others will too. It heightens the energy and authenticity of the performance
					which audiences will eat up.</p>
					<p>But be careful: this is not group-think. While your co-actors are your teammates
					and you want them to do their best (don't forget <a href="#consumption">consumption</a>!),
					you still need to differentiate yourself from each other. In fact, most of the time
					you will be acting contrary to them. But use the energy they are throwing into the
					scene and act on it. Then you'll be swinging like the best of 'em.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="takeitback"><div class="def">Take it Back</div>
					<p>In real life, nobody is perfect. 
					We step in the wrong place, not know where to go, even trip on our own toes.
					And we may be thinking so hard, we actually misspeak.
					Since everyone does this, we simply apologize (if needed) and
					redo/re-speak.</p>
					<p>Actors sometimes get so caught up in doing their lines and blocking perfectly that
					we forget to be human, full of mistakes. But go ahead, do something wrong (or make a
					false start). You can then <strong>take it back</strong>. You'll look very human, and
					this will add a realistic dimension to the moment.</p>
					<p>Taking it back is essentially a specific type of <a href="#spm">spm</a>. 
					A well-timed take-back can
					turn a simple line into something memorable.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="takeyourbeat"><div class="def">Take Your Beat</div>
					<p>A <strong>beat</strong> is simply a pause of just a few seconds. Lesser writers 
					will actually write
					them in the script, not trusting your judgement.
					</p>
					<p>But in the stress of auditions and performances, actors often neglect
					using beats. That's so unfortunate: it's the pauses that create power and
					cues the audience that <em>something important is happening here!</em></p>
					<p>So don't forget to <strong>take your beat</strong>, especially during
					auditions.</p>
				</li>

				<li id=""><div class="def">Toss Off</div>
					<p>Absolutely beautiful and effective, <strong>tossing off</strong> is
					playing the most important line in a scene as if it's nothing&ndash;just a trifle
					or an after-thought. I can't emphasize enough the power of this technique.</p>
					<p class="try">As an exercise, pick a random line in a scene and toss it off.
					You'll be surprised how important that line becomes <em>because</em> you understated it.</p>
				</li>

				<li id="trap"><div class="def">Trap</div>
					<p><strong>Traps</strong> are those gotchas that we all
					make from time-to-time that keep our performances from
					being as good as we want. Most traps stem from laziness
					or ignorance. For beginners and intermediate actors, we
					may not even know that we're doing traps or that there are
					different and better ways of achieving our goals. More
					experienced actors fall into traps out of habit or because they don't have
					the energy to avoid them.</p>
					<p>All these excuses are unexceptable. And it's the mission of
					the Actor's Gym to help each other see the traps we fall in and
					find solutions to avoid them.</p>
					<p>The most common trap is playing the part <a href="#on the nose">on the nose</a>.
					Read that section, learn to recognize OTN writing and acting,
					and then do anything and everything to avoid it.
