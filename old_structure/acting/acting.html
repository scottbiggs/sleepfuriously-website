				An Actor's Gym? What in the world the are you talking about?
			</div>
			<div class="deck">The Actor's Gym is a place where Actors of all levels come to
				work on their skills.</div>


			<div class="ul_header">
				You can (and probably should) treat your acting skills just as
				consciously as an athlete works on their body. The metaphor
				works quite well:
			</div>

			<ul>
				<li>Increase the strength and power<a href="#footnote1">*</a> of your acting capabilities.
				</li>
				<li>You can stretch the skills that you already have.
				</li>
				<li>Increase your endurance.
				</li>
				<li>Add to your repertoire.
				</li>
				<li>Focus your concentration.
				</li>
				<li>Recover from injuries (which usually come from poor
					teaching or incomplete understanding of techniques).
				</li>
				<li>Be relaxed. You can workout and experiment at the Actor's Gym
					without fear of reprimands or reprisals. There is <strong>no</strong> negativity.
					Comments are always limited to <em>likes</em> and <em>adds</em>
					(see our <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page for more info).
				</li>
				<li>Take classes and work collaboratively on your
					skills and techniques. Pick up a few pointers or pass
					your knowledge along.
				</li>

			</ul>


			<p>
				Please take heart that Acting is an extreme sport. It's not for the
				faint of heart, nor the weakly motivated. However, it can be
				a <em>lot</em> of fun!
			</p>

			<p>
				And the better you get, the more fun you'll have. The Actor's
				Gym is a safe place for actors to exercise, practice, train,
				experiment, socialize, and get feedback.
			</p>

			<div class="headline">The Actor's Gym is a Safe Place</div>
			<p>
				Anyone who says that they must break you down before you can learn
				is not a teacher: they're a con artist or worse (yes, there are far
				worse than con artists!). Should you find someone like this, drop
				whatever you're carrying and run--don't
				walk--to the opposite direction!
			</p>
			<p>
				At the Actor's Gym, the only comments allowed are "likes" and
				"adds". For example, "I really liked that burp at the beginning.
				It showed me that you didn't care. How about adding some smirking
				as well?"
			</p>
			<p>
				By limiting feedback, we try to create a safe area--one where
				actors can feel comfortable to experiment and try new ideas
				and modes of working.
			</p>
			<p>
				With freedom to try anything comes opportunities to
				fail (spectacularly!). And nothing teaches better than failure!
			</p>
			<p>
				It has been my experience that often the very best and most
				interesting performances come when actors are relaxed, comfortable,
				and no longer trying to "do it right." So when directing movies,
				I usually say, "That take was perfect! Let's do one more, for fun."
				We almost always use that "for fun" take.

			<div class="headline">Techniques - Workouts - Play</div>
			<div class="deck">
				The Actor's Gym comes in two forms to fit your needs: Techniques
				and workouts.

				Techniques
			</div>
			<p>
				For those interested in learning acting techniques, classes
				based on the writings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Boleslawski">Richard Boleslavsky</a> are available.
				Yeah, I know--who the hell is Boleslavsky? Well I think he has
				the best technique for beginners and intermediate actors.
			</p>
			<p>
				Boleslavsky's technique is straight-forward, no-nonsense,
				and doesn't require anyone to
				surrender their ego to a teacher or school of thought.
				I highly recommend finding a copy of his book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Acting-The-First-Six-Lessons/dp/1626549974" class="underline">Acting, the First Six Lessons</a>
				and reading it right now!

			<div class="headline2">
				Workouts
			</div>
			<p>Workouts, the mainstay of the Actor's Gym, are for people who already have solid techniques and are looking
				to use them, stretch them, supplant them, or simply to experiement.</p>
			<p>Most of our workouts consist of quick self-rehearsals, performances,
			quick evaluation, se</p>

				Play
			</div>
			<p>
				Once in a while, we have workshops using methods touted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_Spolin">Viola Spolin</a>.
				That means <strong>games</strong>! Yes, lots of acting games, each
				game targets some bit of the acting craft. These games work best with
				a mix actors of all backgrounds and abilities. And they're fun, too!
			</p>
			<p>
				Look at the <a href="calendar.html">Calendar</a> for more info about the
				times and places of these special workshops. See you there!
