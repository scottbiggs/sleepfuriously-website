				<h4>da Bug List</h4>
				<p>Your input will make this list much more impressive.  My job
					is to make this smaller by killing, squashing, or even
					fixing those bugs.
				</p>

				<div class="bug">
					<h6>Orientation Crash<span class="number">B1</span></h6>
					Crashes during orientation changes! This happens when
					I'm at the big grid-thing and I repeatedly change orientations.
					This especially happens when I change orientation while the
					"loading" dialog is displayed.
					<div class="date">03/21/2013</div>
					<div class="name">smb</div>
				</div>

				<div class="bug">
					<h6>No Graph<span class="number">B2</span></h6>
					I don't see anything in the "graphs" section.  What's wrong?
					<div class="date">03/21/2013</div>
					<div class="name">smb</div>

				<h4>Feature Requests</h4>
				<p>Here are the features you're asking for:</p>

				<div class="feature">
					<h6>Multiple Users<span class="number">F1</span></h6>

				<h4>Report a Bug or Request Feature</h4>
				<p>
					Right now, just send me an email
					with your bug report or feature request. I'm working on making
					a nice form here, but that takes time--time
					we'd all better appreciate with me getting this app done!
				<br/>
				<br/>
					Please look at the bug or feature list to the left to make
					sure that you're not reporting something that is already on
					the list.  Thanks!
				<br/>
				<br/>
					If you have additional info about a bug that's already reported,
					just include the bug number in your report. The more information
					I can get, the easier it is to repeat it and then fix it.
				<br/>
				<br/>
					My email is the following, but with all the
					numbers removed: <strong>scott6morgan9biggs@g4ma2il.c8om</strong>
