			<img class = "floatright" src="test_image.jpg" alt=""/>
			Now we have the image on the right side of the screen with the
			text wrapping to the left of it. Looks pro to me. Did it by using
			"float" in the css file.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also note that we put a border (with padding to make it look 3d) around the image.  It's the little
			things that matter.
